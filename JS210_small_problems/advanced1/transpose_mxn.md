In the previous exercise, you wrote a function that transposed a 3x3 matrix represented by an array of arrays.

Matrix transposes are not limited to 3x3 matrices, or even square matrices. Any matrix can be transposed simply by switching columns with rows.

Modify your transpose function from the previous exercise so that it works with any MxN matrix with at least one row and one column.

Examples:
```js
transpose([[1, 2, 3, 4]]);            // [[1], [2], [3], [4]]
transpose([[1], [2], [3], [4]]);      // [[1, 2, 3, 4]]
transpose([[1]]);                     // [[1]]

transpose([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 7, 8, 6, 2]]);
// [[1, 4, 3], [2, 3, 7], [3, 2, 8], [4, 1, 6], [5, 0, 2]]
```

# Problem
Modify `transpose()` so it works with any number of columns

# Examples / Test Cases
```js
transpose([[1, 2, 3, 4]]);            // [[1], [2], [3], [4]]
transpose([[1], [2], [3], [4]]);      // [[1, 2, 3, 4]]
transpose([[1]]);                     // [[1]]

transpose([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 7, 8, 6, 2]]);
// [[1, 4, 3], [2, 3, 7], [3, 2, 8], [4, 1, 6], [5, 0, 2]]
```

# Data Structures
Array

# Algorithm
initialize an array of arrays with 3 empty arrays `[[], [], []]` `transposed`
start a for loop, `i` will represent the location in the rows of the input matrix
start a nested for loop, `j` will represent the columns of the input matrix
- iterate over the first element (`i`) on each column (`j`) and push it to `transposed[i]`
when we break from both loops return transposed

# Code:
```js
function transpose(matrix) {
  const transposed = [];
  const rowsCount = matrix[0].length;

  for (let row = 0; row < rowsCount; row += 1) {
    transposed.push([]);
  }

  for (let rowIdx = 0; rowIdx < matrix.length; rowIdx += 1) {
    for (let colIdx = 0; colIdx < matrix[rowIdx].length; colIdx += 1) {
      transposed[colIdx].push(matrix[rowIdx][colIdx]);
    }
  }

  return transposed;
}
```
