# **What is the Internet?**

The internet is a `network of networks`

## **What is a Network?**
At the most basic level, it's two devices connected in such a way that they can communicate or exchange data. A primitive implementation of this would be connecting two computers directly to each other using a LAN cable, and configuring their network settings in such a way that they form a distinct network.

## **Local Area Network (LAN)**
A much more common scenario, such as in an office environment, would be multiple computers and other devices connected via a network bridging device such as a hub or, more likely, a switch. The computers are all connected to this device via network cables, and this forms the network.

## **Inter-network Communication**
In order to enable communication between networks, we need to add routers into the picture. Routers are network devices that can route network traffic to other networks. Within a Local Area Network, they effectively act as gateways into and out of the network.

## **A Network of Networks**
We can imagine the internet as a vast number of these networks connected together. In between all of the sub-networks are systems of routers that direct the network traffic.


# *The actual network topology of the overall network is a bit more complex than that, but in terms of having a mental model on which to build more abstract networking concepts it should suffice.*
