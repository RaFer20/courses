# Normalization

An **update anomaly** is a data inconsistency that results from data redundancy and a partial update.

An **insertion anomaly** is the inability to add data to the database due to absence of other data.

A **deletion anomaly** is the unintended loss of data due to deletion of other data.

**Normalization** is the process of designing schema that minimize or eliminate the possible occurrence of these anomalies. The basic procedure of normalization involves extracting data into additional tables and using foreign keys to tie it back to its associated data.
