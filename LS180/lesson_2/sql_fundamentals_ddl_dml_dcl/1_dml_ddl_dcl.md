SQL consists of 3 different sublanguages.
For example, one of these sublanguages is called the Data Control Language (DCL) component of SQL.
It is used to control access to a database;
it is responsible for defining the rights and roles granted to individual users.
Common SQL DCL statements include:
```sql
GRANT
REVOKE
```

Name and define the remaining 2 sublanguages, and give at least 2 examples of each.



Data Definition Language (DDL) component of SQL is used to create, modify, and delete databases and tables.
DDL is responsible for describing how data is structured. 
Examples:
```sql
CREATE
ALTER
DROP
```

Data Manipulation Language (DML) component of SQL is used to
create, read, update, and delete the actual data in a database.
Examples:
```sql
SELECT
INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE
```
