CRC cards are yet another tool to help you organize your ideas. You don't have to use it if you don't find it helpful. In general, you should follow the below approach.

1. Write a description of the problem and extract major nouns and verbs.

2. Make an initial guess at organizing the verbs and nouns into methods and classes/modules, then do a spike to explore the problem with temporary code.

3. When you have a better idea of the problem, model your thoughts into CRC cards.
