What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby?
Think of as many as you can.

- Helps make it easier to mantain code by encapsulating specific code into smaller parts
- Makes code look more clean by grouping similar behaviors into specific classes or modules
- Using nouns to name Objects and Verbs for some method makes the purpose of the code seem a bit more clear

- Creating objects allows programmers to think more abstractly about the code they are writing.
- Objects are represented by nouns so are easier to conceptualize.
- It allows us to only expose functionality to the parts of code that need it, meaning namespace issues are much harder to come across.
- It allows us to easily give functionality to different parts of an application without duplication.
- We can build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code.
- As the software becomes more complex this complexity can be more easily managed.
