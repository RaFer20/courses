=begin
The error was caused because we didnt specify which arguments to pass to `super` when initializing a new `SongBird` class.
It can be fixed by specifying the first two arguments, the third is used within `SongBird`'s own initialize method

## Further Exploration ##
Is the FlightlessBird#initialize method necessary? Why or why not?

It is not necessary, since we're not adding anything new with it we could just delete it and use it's parent's initialize
