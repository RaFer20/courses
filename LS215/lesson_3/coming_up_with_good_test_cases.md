Here are some general guidelines for creating test cases:

- Input types
-- Can the function take and handle different types of inputs, such as numbers, strings, booleans, and objects?

- Special values
-- If the input is a number, does it work with zero, negative numbers, fractional numbers (e.g., 0.567), or special values (e.g., NaN, Infinity)?

-- If the input is a string, array, or object, does it work with an empty string, array, or object (e.g., '', [], {})?

-- If the input is an array, does it work with a "sparse array" (e.g, [1, , 2]) or an array with an object property (e.g., [1, 2, a: "A"])?

- Valid / Invalid inputs
-- What should we consider as invalid inputs and what should we do with them? For example, if the input is supposed to be a "word", can we assume that it will be a string containing only letters and no other characters? Should we return a specific value—such as null or undefined—if the input isn't a valid word? Should we consider letter case? For example: 'a', 'dog', 'DOG', 'doG', ' dog', 'dog ', 'dog cat', 'dogCat', 'dog_cat', '@', 'dog4', '4dog', '42', 'dog\n'.

-- What should we do when an input has been omitted? For example, should we issue an error message, return a specific value, or set that input to a default value and execute the function normally?

- Cover the requirements we captured in our requirement breakdown as completely as possible.
-- Make sure to cover all the requirements, including both the generic cases and the edge cases.

-- Look for the word, "if", in the requirement breakdown. Conditional requirements need test cases that cover both sides of the condition to have full coverage. For example, the following two test cases cover both sides of the given conditional requirement:
```js
// If one argument is a string and the other is a number,
// convert the second argument to the type of the first argument,
// then return both as a two-element array.
foo('42', 43);                               // ["42", "43"]
foo(42, '43');                               // [42, 43]
```

- Try to avoid testing more than one requirement per test case.
-- Isolating each specific requirement will make it easier to validate and debug our solution later on.
-- On the other hand, it is okay to test a single requirement using more than one test case—especially when testing more complex requirements, such as conditional requirements.


# Example
We are given the problem description: "Write a function called doubler that doubles every value in an array". We are not given any test cases, so we'll have to create them all on our own.

The problem description doesn't give us much to work with, so we won't be able to create appropriate test cases without first asking the interviewer for more information. We ask a series of questions and translate the answers into a list of requirements. Now we can use these requirements to build a complete set of test cases.

here is the list of requirements we derived from the interviewer's answers to our questions:
- elements that are numbers should be multiplied by 2
- elements that are strings should be repeated twice via concatenation
- other types of elements should be duplicated in the array
- the input array should not be mutated
- elements that are special number values should remain unchanged
- elements that are any other type of number should be treated normally (multiplied by 2)
- elements that are empty strings should remain unchanged
- elements that are any other type of string should be treated normally (repeated twice)
- the input array can contain a mixture of different types of elements
- non-primitive elements should have their reference duplicated, not their value
- elements that appear more than once should be treated normally (as specified above)
- elements that contain nested arrays or objects should be treated normally (duplicated)
- if the input array contains empty slots (a "sparse array"), they should be removed
- if an inner array (element) contains empty slots, they should remain unchanged
- if the input array contains any object properties, they should remain unchanged
- if an inner array (element) contains any object properties, they should remain unchanged
- if the array is empty, return an empty array
- if multiple arguments are passed, ignore all but the first
- if the argument is a string, treat it as an array of characters
- if the argument is a non-negative integer, treat it as an array of digits
- if the argument is an object, treat it as an array of its property values
- all other kinds of inputs are invalid, and should return the string 'Invalid input'

Generic Cases:
```js
// elements that are numbers should be multiplied by 2
doubler([1, 2, 3]);                    // [2, 4, 6]

// elements that are strings should be repeated twice via concatenation
doubler(['a', 'b', 'c']);              // ["aa", "bb", "cc"]

// other types of elements should be duplicated in the array
doubler([true, false]);                // [true, true, false, false]
doubler([null]);                       // [null, null]
doubler([undefined]);                  // [undefined, undefined]
doubler([[1], []]);                    // [[1], [1], [], []]
doubler([{ foo: 'bar' }]);             // [{ foo: "bar" }, { foo: "bar" }]
doubler([function foo() {}]);          // [function foo(), function foo()]
doubler([/abc/]);                      // [/abc/, /abc/]

// the input array should not be mutated
let array = [1, 2, 3];
doubler(array);                        // [2, 4, 6]
array;                                 // [1, 2, 3]
```
Edge Cases For Valid Inputs:
```js
// elements that are special number values should remain unchanged
doubler([NaN, Infinity, -Infinity]);   // [NaN, Infinity, -Infinity]

// elements that are any other type of number should be treated normally (multiplied by 2)
doubler([0.42, -5, 0, -0]);            // [0.84, -10, 0, -0]

// elements that are empty strings should remain unchanged
doubler(['']);                         // [""]

// elements that are any other type of string should be treated normally (repeated twice)
doubler([' ', 'aB', '@', '\n', '1']);  // ["  ", "aBaB", "@@", "\n\n", "11"]

// the input array can contain a mixture of different types of elements
doubler([1, 'a', true, [], {}]);       // [2, "aa", true, true, [], [], {}, {}]

// non-primitive elements should have their reference duplicated, not their value
let doubled = doubler([{ a: 'b' }]);
doubled[0] === doubled[1];             // true

// elements that appear more than once should be treated normally (as specified above)
doubler([1, 1, true, true, {}, {}]);   // [2, 2, true, true, true, true, {}, {}, {}, {}]

// elements that contain nested arrays or objects should be treated normally (duplicated)
doubler([[1, [2, 3], {}]]);            // [[1, [2, 3], {}], [1, [2, 3], {}]]
doubler([{ a: [1] }]);                 // [{ a: [1] }, { a: [1] }]

// if the input array contains empty slots (a "sparse array"), they should be removed
doubler([1, , 2, , , 3]);              // [2, 4, 6]

// if an inner array (element) contains empty slots, they should remain unchanged
doubler([[1, , , 2]]);                 // [[1, empty × 2, 2], [1, empty × 2, 2]]

// if the input array contains any object properties, they should remain unchanged
let array = [1, 2];
array.foo = 'bar';
doubler(array);                        // [2, 4, foo: "bar"]

// if an inner array (element) contains any object properties, they should remain unchanged
let array = [1, 2];
array.foo = 'bar';
doubler([array]);                      // [[1, 2, foo: "bar"], [1, 2, foo: "bar"]]

// if the input array is empty, return an empty array
doubler([]);                           // []

// if multiple arguments are passed, ignore all but the first
doubler(['a'], ['b']);                 // ['aa']

// if the argument is a string, treat it as an array of characters
doubler('abc');                        // ["aa", "bb", "cc"]
doubler('123');                        // ["11", "22", "33"]
doubler('');                           // []

// if the argument is a non-negative integer, treat it as an array of digits
doubler(123);                          // [2, 4, 6]
doubler(0);                            // [0]

// if the argument is an object, treat it as an array of its property values
doubler({ a: 1, b: 2 });               // [2, 4]
doubler({ a: 'A', b: [] });            // ["AA", [], []]
doubler({});                           // []
```

Edge Cases For Invalid Inputs:
```js
// all other kinds of inputs are invalid, and should return the string 'Invalid input'
doubler(-1);                           // "Invalid input"
doubler(0.42);                         // "Invalid input"
doubler(Infinity);                     // "Invalid input"
doubler(NaN);                          // "Invalid input"
doubler(true);                         // "Invalid input"
doubler(false);                        // "Invalid input"
doubler(null);                         // "Invalid input"
doubler(undefined);                    // "Invalid input"
doubler(function () {});               // "Invalid input"
doubler(/abc/);                        // "Invalid input"
doubler();                             // "Invalid input"
```
