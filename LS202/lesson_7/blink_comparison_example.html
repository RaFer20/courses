<!-- 
1- Create an HTML file that does nothing more than load the PNG design file
2- Load the HTML in your browser.
3- Set the width and height of your browser as precisely as possible to match the width and height of the PNG file.
4- Create your HTML file and load it in a separate tab.
5- Toggle your browser tabs back and forth between the files (Ctrl-Tab and Shift-Ctrl-Tab work with most browsers).
6- Observe the differences between the design file and your file. Make corrections in your file.
7- Return to step 5 until your files match as well as possible.
