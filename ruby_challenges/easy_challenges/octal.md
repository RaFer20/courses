Implement octal to decimal conversion. Given an octal input string, your program should produce a decimal output. Treat invalid input as octal 0.

Note: Implement the conversion yourself. Don't use any built-in or library methods that perform the necessary conversions for you. In this exercise, the code necessary to perform the conversion is what we're looking for.

*About Octal (Base-8)*

Decimal is a base-10 system. A number 233 in base 10 notation can be understood as a linear combination of powers of 10:

The rightmost digit gets multiplied by 100 = 1
The next digit gets multiplied by 101 = 10
The digit after that gets multiplied by 102 = 100
The digit after that gets multiplied by 103 = 1000
...
The `n*th*` digit gets multiplied by 10n-1.
All of these values are then summed.
Thus:
  233 # decimal
= 2*10^2 + 3*10^1 + 3*10^0
= 2*100  + 3*10   + 3*1

Octal numbers are similar, but they use a base-8 system. A number 233 in base 8 can be understood as a linear combination of powers of 8:

The rightmost digit gets multiplied by 80 = 1
The next digit gets multiplied by 81 = 8
The digit after that gets multiplied by 82 = 64
The digit after that gets multiplied by 83 = 512
...
The n*th* digit gets multiplied by 8n-1.
All of these values are then summed.
Thus:
  233 # octal
= 2*8^2 + 3*8^1 + 3*8^0
= 2*64  + 3*8   + 3*1
= 128   + 24    + 3
= 155

# *Problem*
For our program, the details we need to keep in mind are as follows:

The way to convert octal numbers to decimal numbers is to use base-8 in multiplication.
Going from right-to-left, we multiply each digit of the number by 8 raised to a certain power.
For the first digit (from the right), the power is 0. For the second digit, the power is 1. This continues until we multiply each digit from the number.
Valid octal numbers only include digits 0 through 7.

- The method that performs the conversion to decimal is also responsible for validating the input.
- The method should iterate through the number's digits from right-to-left and compute each digit as a power of base 8.

# *Examples*
From the test cases shown above, we can see that we need to create an Octal class. The class should have 2 methods as follows:

a constructor that accepts a string as an argument that represents an octal number.
a method that converts the argument into decimal and returns it as a number.
We should return 0 if the argument has invalid characters such as letters or the digits 8 or 9.
We may also want to create some helper methods to assist us, but those are optional.

# *Data Structures*
From the test cases, we can see that we're dealing with numbers and strings. We may want to use a collection (such as an array) for helpful built-in methods.

# *Algorithm*
*constructor*

Accepts a string as an argument that represents an octal number.

*Method: convert to decimal (Ruby: to_decimal; JavaScript: toDecimal)*

If any character of the string being converted is not 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, return 0.
Set a starting sum to 0.
Reverse the digits.
Iterate over digits one-by-one.
For the first digit, multiply it by 8**0, then add it to sum.
For the second digit, multiply it by 8**1, then add it to sum.
Keep multiplying and adding to sum until all digits are processed.
Return the sum.
