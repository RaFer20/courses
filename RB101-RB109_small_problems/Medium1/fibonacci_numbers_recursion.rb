The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers starting with 1 and 1 
where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers: 
the 3rd Fibonacci number is 1 + 1 = 2, 
the 4th is 1 + 2 = 3, the 5th is 2 + 3 = 5, and so on. 
In mathematical terms:

F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) where n > 2

Sequences like this translate naturally as "recursive" methods. A recursive method is one in which the method calls itself. 
For example:

def sum(n)
  return 1 if n == 1
  n + sum(n - 1)
end

sum is a recursive method that computes the sum of all integers between 1 and n.

Recursive methods have three primary qualities:

They call themselves at least once.
They have a condition that stops the recursion (n == 1 above).
They use the result returned by themselves.

In the code above, sum calls itself once; it uses a condition of n == 1 to stop recursing; and, n + sum(n - 1)
uses the return value of the recursive call to compute a new return value.

Write a recursive method that computes the nth Fibonacci number, where nth is an argument to the method.

**Problem
Write a recursive method that takes an integer as an argument and returns the nth fibonacci number.

**Examples/Test Cases
fibonacci(1) == 1
fibonacci(2) == 1
fibonacci(3) == 2
fibonacci(4) == 3
fibonacci(5) == 5
fibonacci(12) == 144
fibonacci(20) == 6765

**Data Structures
Input: Integer
Output: Integer

1 => 1
4 => 3
6 => 8
7 => 13

**Algorithm
return `1` if the input number is less than or equal to `2`
Call the fibonacci and pass `number-1` as an argument and add it to the return value of calling it with `number -2` as an argument
return the sum

**Code
=end

def fibonacci(number)
  return 1 if number <= 2
  fibonacci(number-1) + fibonacci(number-2)
end
